This is the exact copy of package exp/norm of the official Go source tree.

The sole purpose of this is to make it easy to access the Unicode normalization
functions from Go 1 for me.

To use it, simply import "github.com/tajtiattila/norm" in your source and use
"go get" command in your source directory to fetch it.
